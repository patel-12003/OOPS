        "## OOPS\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: object-oriented programming is a paradigm that organizes code into \"objects,\" which are instance of classes.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q2 What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: classes in oop are blueprint/template for creating an object.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q3 What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: An object in oop is instance of class.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\"\"\"\"Ans:: Abstraction is a concept of hiding complex implementation, while encapsulation is a bundling of data and methods of a class.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: dunder methods are the methods defined by built-in classes in python and implementing operator overloading in python.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: inheritance refers to process of child receiving the properties of paarent class.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q7 What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: polymorphism refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods or data.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q8 How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: In Python, encapsulation is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's internal state and providing controlled access through method.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q9 What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q10 What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: In Python, class methods and static methods are special types of methods that belong to the class itself rather than to an instance (object) of the class.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q11 What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but with different parameter types or numbers.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q12  What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: Method overriding is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q13 What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:In Python, the property decorator is used to define a getter method that can be accessed like an attribute, but with the logic of a method.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q14 Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:Polymorphism is one of the key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it plays an essential role in making OOP more flexible and powerful.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q15 What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for other classes.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q16  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:There are many advantages of oop such as modularity and code reusability,encapsulation,polymorphism,inheritance,and abstraction.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q17 What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: In Python, class variables and instance variables are both used to store data in a class, but they differ in terms of how they are used, where they are stored, and how they are shared between instances.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q18 What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: one child class may inherit the property of multiple parent class.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q19 Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:\n",
        "In Python, both the __str__ and __repr__ methods are used to define how an object should be represented as a string. While both are related to string representation, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q20 What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) class from within a child (or subclass) class.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q21 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: The __del__ method is a destructor that allows you to define custom cleanup behavior for objects before they are destroyed.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q22 What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:\n",
        "In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that are not bound to an instance of the class, but they have different use cases and behaviors.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q23 How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: In the context of inheritance, polymorphism allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass, while still allowing that method to be called using a reference to the superclass.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q24 What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans:\n",
        "Method chaining in Python OOP refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q25 What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\"\"\"\n"
